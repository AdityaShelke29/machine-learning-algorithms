# Machine Learning Algorithm Implementation Library
## Introduction
The following project is a library of various machine learning algorithms that I have implemented and learned. I am documenting all of the different techniques and methods I have learned so that I can review and relearn certain topics in the future. Please see my full list of notes here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1reXTdLHnpPT4RDELIzk6yGcDnRsMBhSRoFZbTNAOUyM/edit?usp=sharing

In addition, please feel free to add to this repository with implementations of algorithms not included, or feel free to add to the above document. I would love to meet other students and share our knowledge so that we can become better versed in machine learning.
